  <h1>THE DOG AND CAT.</h1>

  <p>A dog and cat, messmates for life,<br>
  Were often falling into strife,<br>
  Which came to scratching, growls, and snaps,<br>
  And spitting in the face, perhaps.<br>
  A neighbour dog once chanced to call <br>
  Just at the outset of their brawl,<br>
  And, thinking Tray was cross and cruel,<br>
  To snarl so sharp at Mrs. Mew-well,<br>
  Growl'd rather roughly in his ear.<br>
  'And who are you to interfere?'<br>
  Exclaim'd the cat, while in his face she flew;<br>
  And, as was wise, he suddenly withdrew.<br>

    It seems, in spite of all his snarling,<br>
    And hers, that Tray was still her darling.<br>
